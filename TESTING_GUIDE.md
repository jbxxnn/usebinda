### Step 1: Create Provider Account
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. Create account with email/password
4. **Verify:** User is created with `role = 'provider'` (not 'customer')

### Step 2: Set Username
1. Go to Settings (`/dashboard/settings`)
2. Set username (e.g., `testprovider`)
3. Save
4. **Verify:** Username is saved in database

### Step 3: Create a Service
1. Go to Services (`/dashboard/services`)
2. Click "Create New Service"
3. Fill in:

   - Description: "Professional house cleaning service"
   - Duration: 60 minutes
   - Buffer: 30 minutes
   - Price: $100
   - Service Areas: Your ZIP code
4. Save
5. **Verify:** Service appears in list

### Step 4: Configure Availability
1. Go to Availability (`/dashboard/availability`)
2. **Set Working Hours:**
   - Monday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM ✅ Enabled
   - Tuesday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM ✅ Enabled
   - Wednesday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM ✅ Enabled
   - Thursday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM ✅ Enabled
   - Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM ✅ Enabled

   - Min Advance Booking: 2 hours
   - Max Advance Booking: 30 days
   - Max Bookings Per Slot: 1

5. Click "Save Availability Settings"
6. **Verify:** Success message appears

### Step 5: Block a Date
1. Scroll to "Blocked Periods"
2. **Add Block:**
   - Start Date: Tomorrow
   - Start Time: 9:00 AM

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: No Slots Appearing

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ Availability settings not saved
2. ❌ Day is disabled in working hours
3. ❌ Date is blocked
4. ❌ Date is outside advance booking window
5. ❌ Service duration too long for working hours

**Solution:**
1. Check availability settings in database
2. Verify working hours for that day
3. Check blocked_periods table
4. Verify min/max advance booking settings
5. Ensure service duration + buffer fits in working hours

### Issue 2: Slots During Break Time

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ Break time days array doesn't include the day
2. ❌ Break time format incorrect
3. ❌ Break time not saved

**Solution:**
1. Check break_times in availability_settings
2. Verify format: `{"start": "12:00", "end": "13:00", "days": ["monday", ...]}`
3. Re-save break times

### Issue 3: Booked Slot Still Available

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ Booking status is 'cancelled'
2. ❌ Booking not saved to database
3. ❌ Wrong provider_id or service_id

**Solution:**
1. Check bookings table for the slot
2. Verify status is 'pending' or 'confirmed'
3. Verify provider_id matches

### Issue 4: 404 on Booking Page

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ Username not set
2. ❌ User role is 'customer' not 'provider'
3. ❌ Middleware blocking access

**Solution:**
1. Set username in settings
2. Check user role in database
3. Verify middleware allows public access to `/[username]`

### Issue 5: "Error fetching availability" on First Visit

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ No availability settings exist for provider
2. ❌ API returns 404 for missing settings

**Solution:**
1. **Fixed:** System now automatically creates default settings
2. Default settings: Mon-Fri 9-5, 30min buffer, 2hr advance booking
3. Settings are created on first API call to `/api/availability`

### Issue 6: No Time Slots Appearing After Setting Availability

**Possible Causes:**
1. ❌ Advance booking rules too restrictive
2. ❌ Date is outside working hours
3. ❌ All slots marked as unavailable due to conflicts

**Solution:**
1. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console) for debug output
2. Look for these messages:
   - "Date not bookable" → Check advance booking rules
   - "Provider doesn't work on this day" → Check working hours
   - "Slot unavailable: in the past" → Try a future date
   - "Slot unavailable: conflicts with break time" → Check break times
3. **Temporary fix:** I've relaxed advance booking rules for testing
4. **Check your availability settings** in `/dashboard/availability`

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Availability Settings
```sql
SELECT * FROM availability_settings WHERE user_id = '<UUID>';
```

### Check Blocked Periods
```sql
SELECT * FROM blocked_periods 
WHERE user_id = '<UUID>' 
AND start_time <= '2025-10-20T23:59:59Z'
AND end_time >= '2025-10-20T00:00:00Z';
```

### Check Bookings for Date
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE provider_id = '<UUID>'
AND date_time >= '2025-10-20T00:00:00Z'
AND date_time < '2025-10-21T00:00:00Z'
AND status IN ('pending', 'confirmed');
```

### Check User Role
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, username FROM users WHERE id = '<UUID>';
```
